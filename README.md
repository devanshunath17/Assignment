# Assignment
This is a demo project to demonstrate the Recycler View in Model View Presenter using Retrofit.
# Model View Presenter
The MVP Designe pattern allows separate the presentation layer from the logic , so that everything about how the interface works is separated from how we represent it on screen. Ideally the MVP pattern would achieve that same logic might have completely different and interchangeable views.
